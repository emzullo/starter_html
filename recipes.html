                <p>Pesto pasta has always been a comfort dish for me; it’s quick, it’s easy, and great food for a dinner party or a comfy night in! It requires six main ingredients, plus additional spices as you see fit. If you’re not in the mood for pasta, you can always eat the pesto sauce on bread, crackers, or eggs! This recipe makes enough for around 4 people, so adjust accordingly. </p>
                <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can add some spinach if you don't have enough basil leaves)</li>
                <li>¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>⅓ cup pine nuts (can sub with same amount of chopped walnuts)</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
                <li>8 oz of your choice of pasta (my preferred is penne, but any type will work)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat up water in a pot for the pasta and put in a teaspoon of salt. </li>
                    <li>Pulse the basil and pine nuts in a food processor. Add a bit of olive oil as need be if the ingredients are too dry. </li>
                    <li>Add the garlic and cheese to the food processor. </li>
                    <li>Once water starts boiling in the pot, add pasta. Stir every couple of minutes. </li>
                    <li>While the food processor is running, slowly pour in olive oil. </li>
                    <li>Once pasta is al-dente, turn off the heat and drain the pasta water. Save some of it if you want your pesto to be slightly thinner. </li>
                    <li>Add the pasta back into the pot, mix in the pesto, and voila! </li>
                </ol>

            <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a delicious dish to have for dinner. I had it for dinner last night! It has a nice mixture of savory and sweet flavors, and is best served with Naan and rice and vegetables. </p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Chicken Marinade</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced ginger</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until well-coated.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>
                <li>Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them over the prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help distribute the heat more evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges.</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, then sauté the onions, ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned. Add the cumin, turmeric, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and garam masala and stir constantly for about 30 seconds, until the spices are fragrant. Stir in the tomato puree, tomato sauce, and 1 ¼ cups of water, then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread.<li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
